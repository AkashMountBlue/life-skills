## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

### Question 1: Most interesting story or idea
* What stood out to me the most was the power of **small, simple habits** to create meaningful change over time.
* BJ Fogg shared stories of people who transformed their health, relationships, and productivity—not by making big, dramatic changes, but by starting with tiny, manageable habits.
* It was fascinating to see how even the smallest actions, like flossing a single tooth or doing a couple of push-ups, could lead to lasting transformation.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

### Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make forming new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?
* **B = Behavior** – The habit you want to perform.
* **M = Motivation** – How much you want to do the habit.
* **A = Ability** – How simple or easy it is to perform.
* **P = Prompt** – The trigger that reminds you to do the habit.

By applying **B = MAP**, you can make habits easier by lowering barriers, linking habits to cues you already have, and adjusting your motivation to match the habit you’re trying to build.

### Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after each habit?
* Celebrating small wins reinforces **positive emotions** in your brain.
* Recognizing and enjoying a success creates **positive feedback**, which makes the habit more likely to stick.
* BJ Fogg emphasizes: *“What you celebrate becomes a habit.”*

### Question 5: Book's perspective on identity
